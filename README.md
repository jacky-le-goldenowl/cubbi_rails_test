## ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ How Sidekiq Works for This System

- Enqueueing Tasks:

  > When the ScheduleTodayNotificationService detects that itâ€™s a userâ€™s birthday, it enqueues a job (SendBirthdayNotificationJob) using Sidekiq. The job is set with a specific execution time using the set`(wait_until: scheduled_time(user))` method, so that it runs precisely at 9 AM in the user's local time.
  > Efficient Scheduling:
  > Sidekiq schedules these jobs in its internal queue without blocking the scheduling service. This allows the scheduling process to quickly complete its scan and offload work to the background.

- Concurrent Job Processing:

  Worker Threads:

  > Sidekiq runs a pool of worker threads that can process multiple jobs concurrently. This means that even if hundreds or thousands of notifications need to be sent, Sidekiq can handle them in parallel without waiting for each job to complete sequentially.
  > Horizontal Scalability:
  > If the load increases (for example, more users or more notifications on the same day), you can scale out by adding more Sidekiq processes or servers. This distributed processing model ensures that the system remains responsive under high demand.

  Error Handling and Retries:

  - Automatic Retry Mechanism:
    > If a job fails (e.g., the external API call to send the notification fails), Sidekiqâ€™s built-in retry mechanism comes into play. The job is automatically retried after a specified delay (5 seconds in this case) until it either succeeds or the maximum number of retries is reached.
  - Custom Error Management:
    > The job uses rescue_from to catch exceptions, update the notification status to failed, and increment the retry count. This granular error handling ensures that failures are tracked and managed without disrupting the processing of other jobs.

  Non-blocking and Asynchronous Processing:

  - Offloading Long-running Tasks:

    > By using Sidekiq, the system offloads potentially time-consuming tasks like sending API requests to a background process. This asynchronous processing means the main application (or scheduling job) isnâ€™t blocked by slow network responses or temporary service outages.

  - Improved Response Times:

  > Since the main user scan and job scheduling are fast and non-blocking, the overall system remains performant even when handling many notifications.

  - Resource Optimization:

    - Batch Processing and Memory Efficiency:
      > In combination with ActiveRecordâ€™s find_each, Sidekiq allows for processing users in manageable batches. This minimizes memory overhead while ensuring that each enqueued job is lightweight.
    - Load Distribution:
      > Sidekiqâ€™s architecture distributes the workload across available threads and servers, making efficient use of system resources and preventing any single process from becoming a bottleneck.

### Job Resilience Explained

**What It Means:**

- **Resilience:**
  - The system is designed to handle rare, unexpected failures (such as a Redis data loss) by ensuring that no scheduled notifications are permanently lost.
- **Reliability:**
  - Even if the in-memory job queue (Redis) suffers data loss or a similar issue, your persistent database records (in the `birthday_notifications` table) retain the pending notifications. This allows the system to recover and reprocess those notifications.

---

### How It Works

1. **Persistent Storage of Notifications:**

   - When a birthday notification is scheduled, a record is created or updated in the database with a status of `scheduled`.
   - This database record acts as a reliable source of truth for notifications that need to be sent, independent of the state of Redis.

2. **Dedicated Re-enqueue Job:**

   - The job `SendScheduledBirthdayNotificationsJob` serves as a safety net.
   - This job periodically invokes the `SendScheduledNotificationService`, which scans the database for all notifications with the status `scheduled`.

3. **Reprocessing Pending Notifications:**

   - The `SendScheduledNotificationService` iterates through each `BirthdayNotification` record with status `scheduled` and re-enqueues the sending job.
   - For each notification found, it re-enqueues the `SendBirthdayNotificationJob` to attempt sending the notification again.
   - **Why This Matters:**
     If a job was lost or not processed due to a temporary Redis outage or any other issue, the database record remains. The re-enqueue job can pick it up and ensure the notification is eventually sent.

4. **Error Handling and Retries:**
   - The actual sending job (`SendBirthdayNotificationJob`) includes mechanisms to handle failures:
     - It retries automatically on errors (with a 5-second delay between attempts).
     - It updates the notification status to `failed` if it eventually fails after several retries.
   - This robust error handling, combined with periodic re-enqueueing, guarantees that every notification is either successfully sent or properly flagged for review.

### => Key Benefits for Scalability and Reliability

- **Data Reliability:**
  Persistent database records provide a fallback in case of transient failures in the job queue (Redis). This means that even if in-memory job data is lost, no notification request is permanently lost.

- **Automated Recovery:**
  The dedicated re-enqueue job continuously monitors and picks up any pending notifications, ensuring they are reprocessed. This minimizes manual intervention and helps maintain service quality.

- **Improved System Resilience:**
  By decoupling the scheduling (data persistence) from job processing (in-memory execution), your system can recover gracefully from infrastructure hiccups. This design is crucial for maintaining high availability and reliability, even under unexpected failure scenarios.

- **Scalability:**
  As the system scales (with more users and notifications), this resilient design ensures that all notifications are accounted for and processed, reducing the risk of data loss and ensuring timely delivery.

### Scalability and Performance of Sidekiq

Sidekiq is designed for high concurrency and efficient job processing. With a properly configured infrastructure and sufficient worker processes, Sidekiq can handle an enormous number of jobs per day. Let's break down an example to illustrate this:

#### Example Scenario

- **Assumptions:**

  - **Job Processing Time:** Each job takes around 100 milliseconds to complete (including tasks like API calls and database updates).
  - **Worker Threads:** The system is configured with 50 worker threads running concurrently.

- **Calculations:**
  - **Per Worker:**
    A single worker can process about 10 jobs per second (since 1 second / 0.1 second â‰ˆ 10).
  - **Total Throughput:**
    With 50 workers, the system can process roughly 50 x 10 = **500 jobs per second**.
  - **Per Minute:**
    500 jobs/second \* 60 seconds = **30,000 jobs per minute**.
  - **Per Hour:**
    30,000 jobs/minute \* 60 minutes = **1,800,000 jobs per hour**.
  - **Per Day:**
    1,800,000 jobs/hour \* 24 hours = **43,200,000 jobs per day**.

#### Real-World Considerations

- **Job Complexity:**
  The actual processing time per job might vary depending on the complexity of the task (e.g., network latency when calling external APIs like Hookbin, or slower database updates). Even if the jobs take longer, Sidekiq's parallel processing capabilities ensure high throughput.

- **Infrastructure Scaling:**
  The above numbers assume a single server with 50 concurrent workers. Sidekiq scales horizontally, meaning you can add more servers to distribute the workload. For instance, with two servers running 50 workers each, the capacity doubles.

- **Optimized Resource Usage:**
  Utilizing techniques like batch processing (using ActiveRecord's `find_each`) and decoupling scheduling from processing ensures that the system uses resources efficiently, even during peak loads.

- **Fault Tolerance:**
  The resilience mechanisms (e.g., retry policies and re-enqueue jobs) guarantee that even if some jobs fail or if there's a temporary data loss in Redis, no scheduled notification is lost, and all jobs are eventually processed.

### Scalability in The Code

The scalability of your system is reflected in several key areas of your code:

1. **Batch Processing with `find_each`:**

   - **Code:**

     ```ruby
     User.find_each do |user|
       # process each user
     end
     ```

   - **Explanation:**
     Using `find_each` allows you to process users in small batches rather than loading all users into memory at once. This reduces memory overhead and optimizes database querying when handling a large number of users.

2. **Separation of Scheduling and Sending Notifications:**

   - **Scheduling Code:**

     ```ruby
     notification = BirthdayNotification.find_or_initialize_by(
       user: user,
       birthday: today_local(user)
     )

     if notification.save! && should_schedule?(notification)
       SendBirthdayNotificationJob.set(wait_until: scheduled_time(user))
                                  .perform_later(notification.id)
     end
     ```

   - **Re-enqueue (Job Resilience) Code Example:**

     ```ruby
     module BirthdayNotifications
       class SendScheduledBirthdayNotificationsJob < ApplicationJob
         queue_as :default

         def perform
           BirthdayNotifications::SendScheduledNotificationService.call()
         end
       end
     end
     ```

   - **Explanation:**
     By separating the scheduling (which creates or updates the notification records) from the sending of notifications, your system can handle each task independently. This separation allows the lightweight scheduling process to quickly offload heavy tasks to background jobs. The dedicated re-enqueue job helps ensure that any scheduled notifications that might have been lost due to transient failures (e.g., a Redis outage) are reprocessed, boosting overall system resilience and scalability.

3. **Leveraging Sidekiq and Multi-threaded Workers:**

   - **Sending Notification Code:**

     ```ruby
     module BirthdayNotifications
       class SendBirthdayNotificationJob < ApplicationJob
         queue_as :default

         retry_on StandardError, wait: 5.seconds, attempts: BirthdayNotification::MAX_RETRIES

         after_perform do |job|
           update_notification_status((job || self).arguments.first, :sent)
         end

         rescue_from(StandardError) do |exception, job|
           update_notification_status((job || self).arguments.first, :failed, exception)
           raise exception
         end

         def perform(notification_id)
           #...
         end
       end
     end
     ```

   - **Explanation:**
     Sidekiq enables concurrent processing by using multiple worker threads. This allows your system to process many jobs simultaneously. With enough workers and servers, your system can scale horizontally to handle millions of jobs per day. The built-in retry mechanism and error handling further enhance reliability by automatically reprocessing failed jobs.

### Sidekiq Job Hooks: after_perform and rescue_from

How `after_perform` and `rescue_from` are used in our `SendBirthdayNotificationJob`:

```ruby
after_perform do |job|
  # This hook runs after the job completes successfully.
  # It updates the notification status to 'sent' to mark that the notification
  # has been successfully processed and prevent duplicate processing.
  update_notification_status((job || self).arguments.first, :sent)
end

rescue_from(StandardError) do |exception, job|
  # This hook catches any StandardError that occurs during job execution.
  # It updates the notification status to 'failed', logs the error, and increments the retry count.
  # Then, it re-raises the exception so that Sidekiq's retry mechanism can take effect.
  update_notification_status((job || self).arguments.first, :failed, exception)
  raise exception
end

```
